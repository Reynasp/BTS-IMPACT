# The Impact of Korean Boyband BTS to the World
The Impact of BTS on Resolving the Problem of Youth Mental Health and How BTS is changing the world through their music

## Who is BTS?
BTS (Hangul: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan) is a 7 membered boyband that is currently at the peak of their career since they’re titled as biggest group in the world due to various international achievements and recognition that they have achieved, such as the award of the best artist, best album, best song and best group since 2017 in Korea, and has topped the billboard charts since 2017, earning the nickname of the best group and top artist in America since 2018 (BBC, 2018). However, debuting in 2013 under the auspices of the Big Hit Entertainment agency, BTS began their career as a group that did not have so many opportunities to appear on music shows due to the group's background as an artist who came out of a small agency namely Big Hit Entertainment, which is this agency not included in the ranks of large agencies such as SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment.


## How's it begin?

In 2013, a group of seven boys, all from different backgrounds, who left behind their friends and family to follow their dream of becoming K-pop artistes, were about to debut. But soon afterwards, their hopes were crushed as the bad press from the media, internal strife and lack of proper finance forced them to almost disband multiple times. But they kept on fighting for their dream, even if that meant living in one cramped dorm room and having to beg people to come to their concerts. These boys had very humble beginnings – one of the members, Yoongi, recently had a surgery to repair a torn shoulder labrum. The tear was related to an injury that occurred in 2012, when the performer was hit by a car during one of his delivery-boy shifts. 
Flash forward to years later, that same group of boys from South Korea, Bangtan Sonyeondan (BTS), are now one of the biggest boy bands in the world. Among other outstanding achievements, they have multiple No. 1 albums in the US Billboard Hot 100, 15 Guinness World Records and over 300 awards. BTS are the youngest recipients of South Korea's Order of Cultural Merit award and the first ever K-pop act to receive a Grammy nomination. They are changing the world and the face of K-pop forever, paving the way for others.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
